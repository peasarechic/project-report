# Notes

## Plan
1. I think it's way better to write everything down on paper first and then type that into latex. Otherwise there's just too
much delay between thinking and excecution. The zeroth draft should be on paper. 

## Project Outline

1. History of Algebraic Geometry
    1. 27 curves
    2. Bezout's theorem
2. Rings and Ideals *
3. Prime and maximal ideal *
4. Prime spectrum Spec(A), Zariski Topology, Ex 17, 18, 16, 20.iv, 21, 26, 27; *
5. Nullstellensatz
6. Modules, tensor product, Exactness properties of tensor products *
7. Localization, Local properties *
8. Intgral dependence, going-up theorem * 
10. Future line of study
11. Further Applications

## Plan of Action
1. Write down on paper a detailed list of definitions, theorems and exercises that you wish to include from only the * ed portions.
2. Do a full info dump where you copy the definitions from your notes as well as from the text book.
3. Go through what you dumped tighten it up and explain it to someone seeing it for the first time. 

Since writing an introduction and making the thing more thematically cohesive is important you can do that first if you want to! Then to fill up the exercises if it's important to the narrative.
