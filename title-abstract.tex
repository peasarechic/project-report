\textbf{Title:} Introduction to Commutative Algebra \\
\textbf{Author:} Amal M \\
\textbf{Abstract:} The motivation for the study of algebraic geometry is how algebraic objects (rings of rational functions) are associated with varieties (zeros of polynomials). This subject florished during the second half of the twentieth century. Algebraic geometry allows us to study the geometry arising from algebraic objects. Core to the deeper understanding of this subject is an understanding of the subject of commutative algebra which studies commutative rings and their ideals and modules. The purpose of the present project is to gain an understanding of commutative algebra through solving exercises from Atiyah-MacDonald's book, Introduction to Commutative Algebra. The reading project comprised of the study of the theory of rings and modules, their tensor product and exact sequences of rings and modules. The project concluded with a proof of the Going-Up Theorem.
